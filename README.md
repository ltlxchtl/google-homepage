The goal of this project was to recreate the basic Google homepage using HTML and CSS.
At first, this seemingly simple project seemed overwhelming to me -- I felt I didn't know where to start;
however, as I began to dig into it, I realized that I actually already knew many of the skills I would need.

By far the trickiest part for me was positioning elements relative to one another so as to match the layout of
the actual Google page. Centering the logo on the page was easy, until I tried to add the navigation bar, at which
point, my beautifully centered logo went askew (weirdly, it did not seem to affect the text bar/buttons that were
below the logo). I found that by assigning a "grid" display to the nav bars, I was able to retain the positioning
of the central elements on the page. I'm a bit embarrassed to say that I still don't entirely understand how changing
to a grid display fixed the other alignment issues (especially since I kept the elements within said grid as floating,
which seemed to be the genesis of the my alignment difficulties), but I think that this will become clear in time.

I had a lot of fun figuring out the styling. My method was a mix of trial and error (mostly for font sizes and weights)
and using the dev tools color sampler. The experience really reminded me of when I was first learning software like Photoshop,
Lightroom, and Final Cut, with a large toolbox with which to play, and various ways of obtaining the same visual outcome.
The difference being, that because I'm actually looking at the "code" here, I felt more drive to determine the "correct"
or most "elegant" solution, rather than using whatever seemed fastest or most immediately obvious.

Overall, I felt like I learned a great deal about the relationships between elements from doing this project--prior to
trying this out, positioning was something that I felt I could read a great deal about but still not really know how to
apply, unlike other CSS properties which felt much more intuitive. I realize this is a pretty easy/very beginner-level
project, but I feel so much more confident and motivated to keep trying from having completed it.
